# Progress Bar

The Progress Bar is a **Responsive** web application designed to manage and visualize progress tracking for various tasks. It provides users with a user-friendly interface to increment, decrement, and reset progress bars efficiently. The application includes an auto-increment feature that allows progress to be updated automatically, along with a stop button to pause the auto-increment functionality when needed.

- Increment and Decrement Controls: Buttons to increase or decrease the progress value by a specified amount.
- Checkbox Selection: Users can select specific progress bars to manipulate based on their current needs.
- Automatic Progress Updates: The application allows users to set an auto-increment feature to update progress automatically,
- **Extra feature** with a **stop button** to pause the auto incrementing process.
